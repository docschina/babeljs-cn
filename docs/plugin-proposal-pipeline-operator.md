## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator
```

## Usage

### With a configuration file (Recommended)

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator", { "proposal": "minimal" }]
  ]
}
```

The Pipeline Proposal is one of three competing implementations. Which implementation the plugin should use is configured with the `"proposal"` option. This option is required and should be one of:

- `"minimal"` â€“ [Minimal Pipeline](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/)
- `"smart"` - [Smart Pipeline](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines) - Added in `v7.3.0`
- `"fsharp"` - [F#-Style Pipeline](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines) - Added in `v7.5.0`

When one of the implementations is accepted, it will become the default and the `"proposal"` option will no longer be required.

### Via CLI

```sh
$ babel --plugins @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("@babel/core").transformSync("code", {
  plugins: [
    [
      "@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator",
      {
        proposal: "minimal",
      },
    ],
  ],
});
```
