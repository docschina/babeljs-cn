> 如果你欣赏我们在 Babel 上所做的工作，你可以在 [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel) 上赞助 Babel，也可在 [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu) 上支持我，或者也可加入到 Babel 的维护行列中。Babel 项目是集合 javascript 社区成员力量的集体成果，我们向他们表示衷心的感谢！

## 进行中！🎉

软件永远都不是完美的，但我们准备发布的版本已经在生产环境中实验了一段时间！[`@babel/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core) 已经达到每月 510 万次的下载量，因为它在类似于 [Next.js 6](https://zeit.co/blog/next6)，[vue-cli 3.0](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-cli-3-0-is-here-c42bebe28fbb)，[React Native 0.56](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/07/04/releasing-react-native-056)，甚至是 [Wordpress 的前端](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso) 中都被广泛使用 🙂！

## Babel 担任的角色

我想通过过去几年中 Babel 在 JavaScript 生态系统中所担任的[角色]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fntd0sPMOtQ))来开始这篇文章。

最初的问题是，与服务器语言不同，JavaScript 没有办法保证对每个用户都有相同的支持，因为用户可能使用不同支持级别的不同浏览器（尤其是旧版本的 Internet Explorer）。如果开发人员想要使用新语法（例如 `class A {}`），旧浏览器上的用户只会因为 `SyntaxError` 的错误而出现屏幕空白的情况。

Babel 为开发人员提供了一种使用最新 JavaScript 语法的方式，同时使得他们不必担心如何进行向后兼容（`class A {}` 转译成 `var A = function A() {}`）。

由于它能转译 JavaScript 代码，它还可用于实现新的功能：因此它已成为帮助 [TC39](https://github.com/tc39)（制订 JavaScript 语法的委员会）获得有关 JavaScript 提案的意见反馈桥梁，并让社区对语言的新功能发表自己的见解。

Babel 如今已成为 JavaScript 开发的基础。[GitHub 目前有超过 130 万个仓库依赖 Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/network/dependents)，[每月 npm 下载量达 1700 万次](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core)，还拥有[数百个用户](http://babeljs.io/users)，其中包括许多主要框架（React，Vue，Ember，Polymer）以及著名公司（Facebook，Netflix，Airbnb）等。它已成为 JavaScript 开发的基础，许多人甚至不知道它正在被使用。即使你自己没有使用它，但你的依赖很可能正在使用 Babel。

## 核心开发

Babel 不仅影响着语言本身的未来，也对社区和生态系统产生巨大了影响。即时承担着这么巨大的责任，可 Babel 也仅仅是一个由几名志愿者组成的社区驱动项目。

去年，团队里的一些伙伴才在线下相见：

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original <a href="https://twitter.com/babeljs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@babeljs</a> team, at last together.

尽管这只是一个公告帖，但我想借此机会告诉大家这个项目的状态。

我自己也是在 6.0 版本发布前几个月加入，当时 Babel 拥有很多争议和反对意见。那些争议导致现有维护人员精疲力竭（包括 [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebmck)，Babel 的创作者），我们中的一些人选择了离开。

像许多维护者一样，我们偶然发现了 Babel 所担任这个角色。我们中的许多人没有对编译器的工作原理或如何维护开源项目进行过正式培训。更具讽刺的是，我甚至故意避免攻读大学的计算机科学专业，因为我不想上编译器或任何底层课程，因为它似乎显得无趣且非常困难。然而，我发现自己被工具，格式化，Babel 和 JavaScript 语言所吸引。

我想鼓励大家研究一下你所依赖的开源项目并支持它们（如果可能的话，还有时间和资金方面的支持）。

许多维护者也并不是他们所从事工作方面的专家；并且工作中还有许多工作要进行。你必须拥有好奇心和谦虚心，这两者都是作为维护者的重要属性。我的愿望是项目拥有美好的未来，而不是我们所有人都在[做的"任务"](https://twitter.com/TheLarkInn/status/990790109799870469)。

Babel 不是一家公司，也不像 Facebook 这样级别大公司的开源团队。只有少数[志愿者](https://babeljs.io/team)在 Babel 工作，而我也只是最近几个月[离职后](https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/969793227862790144)，并且成为迄今为止唯一一位全职开源工作者。但人们可以来去匆匆，生活在这种“爱好”之外，抚养家庭，做不同的事，换不同的工作或寻找不同的工作等。我们是否竭尽所能来维持那些对我们工作来说至关重要的事，还是说我们让基金会慢慢感到失望？我们如何保证开源项目的受欢迎且应用广泛，并且有明确的界限？我们可以学习[其他维护者的经验](https://github.com/nayafia/awesome-maintainers)？

虽然开源明确接管了软件，但我们真的可以认为它处于健康状态而不考虑其背后的[维护者](https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/)吗？

现在让我们来看看 Babel 的变化！！

## 重大突破性变化

> 一切变化都记录在我们的[迁移指南](http://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration)中。使用我们新的 [`babel-upgrade`](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade) 工具可以自动完成许多更改，也可以以后添加。

- 删除对不进行维护的 Node 版本的支持：0.10，0.12，4，5([详情](http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0#drop-support-for-unmaintained-node-versions-010-012-5-4315-https-githubcom-babel-babel-issues-4315))
- 通过使用 "scoped" 包将 babel 移动到 `@babel` 的命名空间中([详情](http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release#renames-scoped-packages-babel-x))。这有助于区分官方依赖包，因此 `babel-core` 变为 `@babel/core` 。
- 删除（并停止发布）任何年度 preset（`preset-es2015` 等）([详情](http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release#deprecated-yearly-presets-eg-babel-preset-es20xx))。 [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env.html) 取代了对这些内容的需求，因为它包含了所有年度所添加内容以及针对特定浏览器集兼容的能力。
- 同时删除 ["Stage"](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) 等 presets (`@babel/preset-stage-0` 等) 转而选择使用单独的提案插件。同样，默认情况下从 `@babel/polyfill` 删除提案。([详情](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8440))请阅读整篇[文章](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/27/removing-babels-stage-presets)以获取更多相关信息。
- 些许包进行重命名：任意 TC39 提案的插件现在都是 `-proposal` ，而不是 `-transform` ([详情](http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release#renames-proposal))。 因此，`@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties` 变为 `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`。
- 为某些面向用户的依赖包引入 `@babel/core` 的 `peerDependency` (例如 `babel-loader`，`@babel/cli` 等) ([详情](http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release#peer-dependencies-integrations))

## `babel-upgrade`

[`babel-upgrade`](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade) 是我们开始尝试自动进行升级更新的新工具：目前只适用于 `package.json` 和 `.babelrc` 的配置文件。

我们建议直接在 git 的仓库中运行 `npx babel-upgrade`，或者你可以使用 `npm i babel-upgrade -g` 进行全局安装。

如果你想修改该文件，你可以传递 `--write` 和 `--install` 进行。

```sh
npx babel-upgrade --write --install
```

你可以通过编写 issues 或提交 PRs 来帮助每个人过渡到 Babel 7！未来的规划是，我们会将此工具用于所有重大的版本更新，并会为项目中的 PR 创建机器人。

## JavaScript 配置文件

We are introducing [`babel.config.js`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babelconfigjs.html). It isn't a requirement or even a replacement for `.babelrc`, but having this may be useful in *certain cases*.

`*.js` configuration files are fairly common in the JavaScript ecosystem. ESLint and Webpack both allow for `.eslintrc.js` and `webpack.config.js` configuration files, respectively.

Below is the case of only compiling with a plugin in "production" (you can do this already with the `"env"` option in a `.babelrc` file):

```js
var env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    env === "production" && "babel-plugin-that-is-cool"
  ].filter(Boolean)
};
```

`babel.config.js` has a different config resolution than a `.babelrc`. It will always resolve the config from that file versus originally when Babel would do a lookup from each file upward until it found a config. This makes it possible to take advantage of the next feature posted below, `overrides`.

## Selective Configuration with `overrides`

Recently, I published a [post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/06/26/on-consuming-and-publishing-es2015+-packages) with thoughts on both publishing ES2015+ packages and also consuming/compiling them.

There's a [section](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/06/26/on-consuming-and-publishing-es2015+-packages#selective-compilation-with-overrides) that goes into using a new key in Babel's config called `overrides` which allows you to specify different configs per glob.

```javascript=
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    // defeault config...
  ],
  overrides: [{
    test: ["./node_modules"],
    presets: [
      // config for node_modules
    ],
  }, {
    test: ["./tests"],
    presets: [
      // config for tests
    ],
  }]
};
```

This allows an application that requires different compilation configs for its tests, client code, and server code to skip needing to create a new `.babelrc` file per folder.

## Speed 🏎

Babel itself is [faster](https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/927554660508028929) so it should take less time to build! We've made a lot of changes to optimize the code as well as [accept](https://twitter.com/bmeurer/status/924346958810107904) [patches](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/924349334346276864) from the [v8](https://twitter.com/v8js) team. We're glad to be a part of the [Web Tooling Benchmark](https://github.com/v8/web-tooling-benchmark) alongside many other great JavaScript tools.

### Output Options

Babel has supported [preset and plugin options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/plugins#plugin-options) for some time now. To recap you can wrap the plugin in an array and pass an options object to the plugin:

```diff
{
  "plugins": [
-   "pluginA",
+   ["pluginA", {
+     // options here
+   }],
  ]
}
```

We've made some changes to the `loose` option of some plugins and added some new options for others! Note by using these options you are opting into non-spec compliant behavior and should know what you are doing; this can become an issue when you switch off of compiling to use the syntax natively. These kinds of options are best used in a library, if at all.

- For classes, `class A {}` will now not include the `classCallCheck` helper.

```javascript
class A {}
```

```diff
var A = function A() {
-  _classCallCheck(this, A);
};
```

- There is a new option if every use of a `for-of` loop is just an array: `["transform-for-of", { "assumeArray": true }]`

```javascript
let elm;
for (elm of array) {
  console.log(elm);
}
```

```javascript
let elm;

for (let _i = 0, _array = array; _i < _array.length; _i++) {
  elm = _array[_i];
  console.log(elm);
}
```

- We exclude the `transform-typeof-symbol` plugin in `loose` mode for `preset-env` [#6831](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6831)

We've found a lot of libraries doing this already, so we decided to do this by default.

Note that the default behavior is to be as spec compliant as possible so that switching off of Babel or using `preset-env` is seamless vs. allowing smaller output just to save bytes (there's a tradeoff there that each project can make). We plan to work on better docs and tooling to make that easier.

### "Pure" Annotation Support

After [#6209](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6209), transpiled ES6 classes are annotated with a ``/*#__PURE__*/`` comment that allows gives a hint to minfiers like [`Uglify`](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) and [`babel-minify`](https://github.com/babel/minify) for dead code elimination. These annotations are added to other helper functions as well.

```js
class C {
  m() {}
}
```

```js
var C =
/*#__PURE__*/
function () {
  // ...
}();
```

There might be more opportunities for minifier hints and optimizations, let us know!

## Syntax

### [TC39 Proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) Support

I'd like to re-iterate that [we've removed the Stage presets](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/27/removing-babels-stage-presets) in favor of a policy of asking users to explicitly opt-in to proposals < Stage 4.

The concern is that we are automatically opting people into syntax that is not fixed or done with the expectation that it will not change. But this is not the case, especially for proposals that are Stage 0 or 1. This [post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal) explains a bit on the kind of thinking behind newer ideas.

Here's a small listing of some of the new syntax Babel supports (keep in mind this feature set is a moving target that could be added/removed/stalled) and which ones have been added in v7:

- ES2018: [Object Rest Spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread) (`var a = { b, ...c }`)
- ES2018 (new): [Unicode Property Regex](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-unicode-property-regex)
- ES2018 (new): [JSON Superset](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-json-strings) 
- ES2015 (new): [`new.target`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-new-target)
- Stage 3 (new): [Class Private Instance Fields](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties) (`class A { #b = 2 }`)
- Stage 3 (WIP): [Static Class Fields, Private Static Methods](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8052) (`class A { static #a() {} }`)
- Stage 3 (new): [Optional Catch Binding](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding) `try { throw 0 } catch { do() }`
- Stage 3 (new): [BigInt](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-syntax-bigint) (syntax only)
- Stage 3: [Dynamic Import](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import) (`import("a")`)
- Stage 2 (new): [`import.meta`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-syntax-import-meta) (syntax only) (`import.meta.url`)
- Stage 2 (new): [Numeric Seperators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-numeric-separator) (`1_000`)
- Stage 2 (new): [`function.sent`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-function-sent)
- Stage 2: [`export-namespace-from`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from) (`export * as ns from 'mod'`), split from `export-extensions`
- Stage 2: Decorators. Check below for an update on our progress!
- Stage 1: [`export-default-from`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-default-from) (`export v from 'mod'`), split from `export-extensions`
- Stage 1 (new): [Optional Chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining) (`a?.b`)
- Stage 1 (new): [Logical Assignment Operators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-logical-assignment-operators) (`a &&= b; a ||= b`)
- Stage 1 (new): [Nullish Coalescing Operator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator) (`a ?? b`)
- Stage 1 (new): [Pipeline Operator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator) (`a |> b`)
- Stage 1 (new): [Throw Expressions](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-throw-expressions) (`() => throw new Error("a")`)

> It's hard for anyone to keep track of all the proposals, so we attempt to do that at [babel/proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals/).

### TypeScript Support (`@babel/preset-typescript`)

We worked with the [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) team on getting Babel to parse/transform type syntax with `@babel/preset-typescript`, similar to how we handle [Flow](https://flow.org/) with `@babel/preset-flow`.

> For more details check out this [post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/08/27/typescript-and-babel-7/) from the TypeScript team!

Before (with types):

```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

function greeter(person : Person) {
  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
```

After (types removed):

```typescript
function greeter(person) {
  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
```

Both Flow and Typescript are tools that enable JavaScript users to take advantage of gradual typing, and we'd like to enable both in Babel. We plan on continuing to work closely with both of their respective teams at FB and Microsoft (in addition to the community-at-large) to maintain compatibility and support new features.

> This integration is fairly new, so it's possible some syntax isn't supported fully. We'd appreciate your help in [reporting issues and maybe sending a PR](https://github.com/babel/babel/labels/area:%20typescript?page=2&q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22area%3A+typescript%22)!

### JSX Fragment Support (`<>`)

As mentioned in the [React Blog](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/11/28/react-v16.2.0-fragment-support.html), JSX Fragment support has been available as of `beta.31`.

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
    </>
  );
}

// output 👇

render() {
  return React.createElement(
    React.Fragment,
    null,
    React.createElement(ChildA, null),
    React.createElement(ChildB, null)
  );
}
```

## Babel Helpers Changes

> The [babel-upgrade PR](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade/pull/71) is in progress

`@babel/runtime` has been split up into `@babel/runtime` and `@babel/runtime-corejs2` ([PR](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8266)). The former only contains Babel's helper functions and the latter contains that as well as any polyfill functions (e.g. `Symbol`, `Promise`).

Babel may need to inject certain functions into the code that can re-used. We just call these "helper functions" just like functions that are shared between modules.

An example of this is with compiling a `class` (without `loose` mode on): 

The specification says that you need to call a class with `new Person()` but if it's compiled to a function you could technically just do `Person()` so we include a runtime check for this.

```js
class Person {}
```

```js
function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function"); } }

var Person = function Person() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Person);
};
```

With `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` and `@babel/runtime` (as a dependency), Babel can extract the individual functions and just require the modular functions to enable smaller output like so:

```js
var _classCallCheck = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/classCallCheck");

var Person = function Person() {
  _classCallCheck(this, Person);
};
```

The same can be done with `external-helpers` and `rollup-plugin-babel`. We are looking into seeing if we can automatically do this in the future. Look out for a standalone post on Babel's helpers soon.

## Automatic Polyfilling (experimental)

Polyfills are necessary for enabling features like `Promise`, `Symbol` in environments that do not have support for them. This is important when differentiating between what Babel does as a compiler (transforms *syntax*) vs. a polyfill (implements built-in functions/objects).

It's easy enough to just import something that covers everything like `@babel/polyfill`:

```js
import "@babel/polyfill";
```

But it includes the whole polyfill, and you may not need to import everything if browsers support it already. This is the same problem that `@babel/preset-env` tries to solve with syntax, so we apply it here with polyfills. The option `useBuiltins: "entry"` does this by splitting the original import into only the imports that are necessary.

But we can do better by only importing the polyfills that are used in the codebase. The option `"useBuiltIns: "usage"` is our first attempt at enabling something like that ([docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins)).

It will run through each file and inject an import at the top of each file if that built-in is "used" in the code. For example:

```js
import "core-js/modules/es6.promise";
var a = new Promise();
```

The inference isn't perfect so there may be false positives.

```js
import "core-js/modules/es7.array.includes";
a.includes // assume a is an []
```

Other ideas in this space are to use [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) if you are ok with relying on a service (or read how [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) used it to [build a hosted service at PayPal](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/polyfill-as-needed-with-polyfill-service-35f0ff306a26)).

## Misc

### Babel Macros 🎣

One of the best parts of Babel is the pluggability of the tool. Over the years, Babel went from being just a "6to5" compiler into a code transform _platform_, enabling some fantastic optimizations for both user and developer experience. [Tons of Babel plugins have been developed](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Ababel%20plugin) for specific libraries and use cases to improve performance and capabilities of library APIs that would not be possible otherwise (some "libraries" are completely transpiled away resulting in no runtime at all).

Unfortunately, adding these plugins to your codebase requires changing configuration (which some toolkits like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) don't allow) and it adds complexity to your code because developers have to know what Babel plugins are operating on a file to know what will happen to the code they're writing. These problems have been solved by [babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)!

Once `babel-plugin-macros` has been installed and [added to your config](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/user.md) (it's included in `create-react-app` v2), you don't need to bother with your configuration to use any macros. In addition, it's even easier to [write your own custom transforms](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md) for use cases specific to your app or one part of your code.

Learn more about `babel-plugin-macros` in our original post ["Zero-config code transformation with babel-plugin-macros"](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/11/zero-config-with-babel-macros).

### Module Targetting

Babel has always attempted to balance the size impact of transformations and capabilities they provide to JavaScript authors. In Babel 7, it has become much easier to configure Babel to support the growing popularity of the [module/nomodule pattern](https://github.com/kristoferbaxter/preset-env-modules).

Notably, several CLI tools for popular web frameworks ([1](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/browser-compatibility.html#modern-mode), [2](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/pull/583)) are already leveraging support leading to a roughly 20% reduction in shipped JavaScript to consumers of applications transpiled by Babel.

### Caller Metadata and Better Defaults

We've added a [`caller` option](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8485) to `@babel/core` so our tooling can pass metadata to presets/plugins. For example: `babel-loader` can add something [like this](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/pull/660) so that `preset-env` can automatically disable the module transformation (same with `rollup`:

```js
babel.transform("code;", {
  filename,
  presets: ["@babel/preset-env"],
  caller: {
    name: "babel-loader",
    supportsStaticESM: true,
  },
});
```

This is exciting since it enables a way for tooling to provide better defaults and less configuration! For the case of webpack/rollup: we can automatically defer to using their module transformation instead of Babel's (same with `import("a")`). Look out for more tooling to take advantage of this in the future!

### `class C extends HTMLElement {}`

> One of our oldest issues gets it's own heading ([details](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7020))

Babel has always had the caveat where it could not support extending native built-ins (`Array`, `Error`, etc) and now it can! We've gotten a lot of issues about this; 🎉 you should celebrate like [Andrea](https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/940724280035303430)!

This change was made to the class plugin so it should be automatically enabled if you are using `preset-env`.

### Website Changes 🌏

We've moved our site from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)!

We're still in the process of setting up [translations](https://github.com/babel/website/issues/1619) with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/babeljs), and with Babel 7 out, we will be in a better place to start that process.

#### REPL

![](https://i.imgur.com/j0qOllj.png)

We've rewritten the [REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl) as a [React Component](https://github.com/babel/website/tree/master/js/repl), and have been working with Ives on integrating better with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). This allows you to install any plugin or preset from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=babel-plugin) in the REPL as well as get any updates that [CodeSandbox](https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client) gets.

We're participating in [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) again! This time, [Gyujin](https://twitter.com/MarinaGJCho) and [Sujin](https://twitter.com/sujinleeme) have been working hard to integrate [Boopathi's](https://twitter.com/heisenbugger) [babel-time-travel](https://github.com/babel/babel-time-travel) into the REPL which you can already test now!

There are so many opportunities here to get involved to make Babel, [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AST), and other tools work better!

### We Have A Song 🎶

> Hallelujah—In Praise of Babel

One day, [Angus](https://twitter.com/angustweets) graciously [imparted](https://twitter.com/angustweets/status/938817321652576256) to us a [song](https://medium.com/@angustweets/hallelujah-in-praise-of-babel-977020010fad) which I thought was amazing, so why not make it our "official" song? And [Shawn](https://twitter.com/swyx) made a brilliant cover [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40abpedBKK8).

You can find it in our repo at [SONG.md](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/SONG.md). We hope to see other projects follow up on this!

## What's Next?

- Babel is inherently tied to what it compiles: JavaScript. As long as there are new additions to propose/work on there is work to be done there. That includes the time/effort to implement and maintain the syntax even before it becomes "stable". We care about the whole process: the upgrade path, education of new features, teaching of standards/language design, ease of use, and integration with other projects.
  - Related: we are almost finished implementing [the new decorators proposal](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7976) in Babel thanks to [Nicolò](https://twitter.com/NicoloRibaudo). It has been a long journey (it has taken [more than one year](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6107#issue-135801160)!) because the new proposal is completely different and much more powerful than the old one, but it is almost there 🎉. You can expect it to be released in one of the next minor versions, alongside with a blog post which will explain the changes in detail.
- [Boopathi](https://twitter.com/heisenbugger) has been diligently maintaining [`babel-minify`](https://github.com/babel/minify), so we'll being doing a 1.0 for that next!
- There are a lot of new features in the works: plugin ordering, better validation/errors, speed, re-thinking loose/spec options, caching, using Babel asynchronously, building against itself from CI, smoke tests, running test262. Check out this [roadmap](http://babeljs.io/docs/en/roadmap) doc for some more possible ideas!

We have no secret plans: we're trying the best we can with what we have to serve this community.

## Open Source is a Mirror

I'd love if we'd have the time and resources to accomplish all of these ideas and to do it well. But as we've shown with this current release, things take much longer than expected!

Why do these releases take so long anyway? Is it from the feature creep, both from ourselves and our users? Was it because we don't understand how to prioritize among all the possible things to add or fix? Deciding to fix low-hanging fruit vs. fundamental issues until the end? Or "distractions" from helping others on GitHub, Slack, Twitter? Are we just bad are estimating our time, understanding the complexities of these issues, overcommitting as volunteers?

Or are we just setting too high of an expectation on ourselves, or feel so pressured by others to perform and fit to their needs at the harm of ourselves? I can only describe it as dread when seeing a message from someone online wondering why something hasn't been released while another asks why this bug isn't fixed yet. I want to just rush it out and be done with it but I also have a desire to take this seriously. 

I've tried to [express](https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/1032348719931432961) some of these thoughts and struggles in my talk last week at React Rally: [Through the (Open Source) Looking Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0sfFX7WH1c), which I hope you can take an opportunity to listen to. The question I ask myself: What can I do about the inevitable cycle of maintainer burnout, constant anxiety, and unrealistic expectations?

Like much of life, the things we do reflect our character and show us how we really are. The actions we take can in themselves can change us, for better or for worse. If we are to take our work seriously, we should keep one another accountable in these habits that seem so embedded in our culture: of instant gratification, success in terms of metrics, entitlement vs. gratitude, and pride in overworking.

But despite all of it, working towards this release has been so worth it.

## Thanks

This is truly a really exciting release, not only through looking back at what we've accomplished and enabled, but much more just knowing how much time and heart was put into making it happen over the last year. It's hard to believe the opportunities and experiences that have happened along the way: interacting with and helping companies from all over the world, finding friends in almost any city I've visited, and speaking honestly about the unbelievable journey this group has taken up together.

Personally, I've never really put so much of my mental energy into anything of this magnitude and I'd like to thank so many people for lifting us up along the way. Shoutouts in particular to [Logan Smyth](https://twitter.com/loganfsmyth) who has spent countless time to change so much of how the core works and always takes time to be so helpful in our Slack while also working freelance and [Brian Ng](https://twitter.com/existentialism) who has stepped up in such a big way to continue to maintain Babel as well as review all my blog posts and talks. [Daniel Tschinder](https://twitter.com/TschinderDaniel), [Sven Sauleau](https://twitter.com/svensauleau), [Nicolò Ribaudo](https://twitter.com/NicoloRibaudo), and [Justin Ridgewell](https://github.com/jridgewell) have all just been instrumental in making this release possible and enjoyable to work on.

Shoutout to all the many community members on Slack, Twitter, and across all the projects on GitHub that also have to understand what we are doing for their own users. I'd like to give a huge thanks to my friends at [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)/[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) for sponsoring me for almost a year to work on Babel half time before deciding to go full-time (as well as helping test Babel 7 in production throughout the whole time I was there). Big thanks to all of our [sponsors](https://babeljs.io/#sponsors) for our Open Collective, especially [Trivago](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/16/announcing-babels-new-partnership-with-trivago) and [Handshake](https://handshake.org/). And thanks to our friends and family for all their love and support.

We're all pretty tired at this point, but it's truly been an honor and privilege to serve in this way, so we hope you appreciate the release!
