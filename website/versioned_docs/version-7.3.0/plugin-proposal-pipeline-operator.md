## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": [["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator", { "proposal": "minimal" }]]
}
```

The Pipeline Proposal is one of three competing implementations. Which implementation the plugin should use is configured with the `"proposal"` option. This option is required and should be one of:

* `"minimal"` â€“ [Minimal Pipeline](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/)
* `"smart"` - [Smart Pipeline](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines)
* `"fsharp"` - [F#-Style Pipeline](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines) (Coming Soon!)

Only "minimal" and "smart" are currently supported. "fsharp" is still in progress.

When one of the implementations is accepted, it will become the default and the `"proposal"` option will no longer be required.

### Via CLI

```sh
$ babel --plugins @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("@babel/core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator"]
});
```
